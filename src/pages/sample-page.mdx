# Sample Page

This is a sample page that I use to see how different elements will appear within the blog. For example, here is a how a link looks: [http://google.com](http://google.com).

```jsx
// Here is some sample code
const x = y;
```
```
some more code
```

### This is a subheader

Sometimes you need lists that are numbered:

1. Cat
2. Hat

While sometimes just bullets are fine:

- Cat
- Hat

And *sometimes* emphasis is **necessary**!
