# Abandoning Free Will in the Self&#8209;Help Journey

Let's start with what this post is not.

It is not about whether free will or determinism is the correct approach for understanding human behavior. There are already many words dedicated to that age-old inquisition.

Instead, this post describes an idea that I am personally experimenting with in my own self-help journey. The idea is a movement towards removing the _self_ from _self-help_.

My hypothesis is that free will &mdash; i.e. putting responsibility on the individual for change &mdash; is actually a terribly poor and distorted mental map to use when navigating your self-help journey. The alternatives can be much more empowering and effective.

### A Simple Equation

The fundamental presumption of self-help is that there is some future person (`Y`) you want to be and there is some person (`X`) that you are now. Something needs to happen for `X` to become `Y` &mdash; some set of `conditions` that must be fulfilled.

```
Today     +------------+       Tomorrow
-----  +  | conditions |   =>  --------
  X       +------------+          Y

Note: conditions may not exist
```

This sounds simple, but it's not. It's just a starting off point. There are a few caveats here.

- _Reality_: `Y` must be reasonable enough such that some `conditions` could be found to satisfy it. Alas our biggest constraint is reality. No matter how hard I try, I'll most likely never find the `conditions` required to satisfy the equation if:
  ```
  Y = Become Spiderman and defeat Venom
  Y = Become 2 years old again
  ```
- _Discoverability_: Assuming that `Y` is possible, there is still the chance that figuring out the `conditions` to satisfy the equation is a wickedly hard problem to solve. Sure, it is definitely within the realm of possibility to satisfy `Y = create a $1B startup`. Figuring out the tremendous list of `conditions` to make that happen is the challenge.

### The Free-Will Trap

I tend to think that we take too much responsibility over our actions. This is the free will trap. We believe that we can _will_ ourselves towards `Y` because we have the power of choice. We make the `conditions` too much about ourselves, too much about that thing within all of us that we tend to call a &ldquo;soul&rdquo;. This then also makes any failure to achieve `Y` also about us and triggers negative self-talk.

> Argh. `Y = Get a 6 pack` is just not happening. If `conditions = I am a tenacious, motivated, person who achieves success in things I set my mind to` then it surely would have happened. I guess I'm not. I must be a lazy bum. I must be a failure.

As you can see, the downside here is that this can create an inclination towards sloppy self-labeling. We end up constantly judging and rating ourselves. In fact, taken straight from the free will page on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will):

> Free will is closely linked to the concepts of responsibility, praise, guilt, sin, and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.

Aside from praise, all of those other things don't sound very fun! When you involve the ego, it is not a fun ride.

### An alternative: You are a product of your environment

Advertisers and marketers get this, why don't we?

Putting candy by the cash register tends to get you to purchase it when checking out at the grocery store. Showing images of relevant products on your newsfeed tends to get you to make purchasing decisions. An app on your phone showing a notification badge tends to get you to tap on it.

As much as we'd like to believe in our illusion of total choice, there are proven, systematic ways to influence human behavior. It's been well studied. Just look into the vast literature on behavioral economics.

Our environment shapes us tremendously. This wisdom is hidden in many different pockets of life. Ever hear the phrase: &ldquo;You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with&rdquo;? Or &ldquo;it's a pity, the system failed him&rdquo;? Or even the management articles praising the importance of team culture in producing results? These all are different views of the same general truth.

Your environment shapes you. But the empowering part? You can also shape your environment.

This knowledge allows us to take the blame off of ourselves, while still keeping ownership and responsibility. You shift the responsibility from your ability to achieve `Y`, to your ability **to&nbsp;create** an environment that brings about the you that achieves `Y`. This subtle yet powerful misdirection is a great psychological frame, and the mental model I choose to use.

Take ownership in shaping the environment, that will in turn shape you to become the person you want to become.

Want to become more of a gym rat? Surround yourself with those that do, and I guarantee you will start to see your behavior change. Perhaps you start listening to Jocko's [podcast](http://jockopodcast.com/). Maybe you start following a bunch of bodybuilders on Twitter and see their tweets float across your feed and hence your consciousness. Take advantage of the human desire to mimic our surroundings, which Rene√© Girard describes as [mimetic desire](https://www.iep.utm.edu/girard/#H2).

Don't take responsibility for your ability or inability to get `Y` done. However, do take responsibility in designing the environment that would produce the version of you that will get `Y` done.

More to come on strategies for doing this.
