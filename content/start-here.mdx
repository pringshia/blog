# Hi, I'm Pratik.

I love remixing ideas.

I think ideas are best when they are freed from their silos. When they are permitted to intermingle, to cross-pollinate, to err, and to flourish.

I like to build things, break them, and build again.

Optimization is fun, yet I don't fret it too much. Sometimes the longer walk home is more fun.

This blog is a work-in progress.
