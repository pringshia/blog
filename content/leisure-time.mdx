# Leisure Time

When was the last time you were able to feel a sense of suspended stillness over a meaningul period of time? A guiltless sense of peace. No place to be, no desire for momentum or direction...just a sense of fulfillment in the present moment.

This freedom to be, to wonder, to wander, has becoming increasingly scarce in the modern day consumer-industrial complex. During the brief blip of human history that is the last 200 years, we have experienced a major assault on our leisure time. Unfortunately, it has become a privilege afforded to very few wage-earners.

Economically, we're part of a system that produces goods while stimulating our desire to consume these goods. The system has also gotten *extremely* efficient at both these things. For most of us, we end up in a situation of exchanging our on-going labor for an on-going stream of novel goods.

9-6 with 20 vacation days. This is the price we pay to sustain this lifestyle. Whatever time is leftover is being aggresively chased after by businesses. Notifications. Infinite scroll. Auto-play. Alcohol. Taco Tuesdays and Happy Hours. We offer up our precious leisure time for increasingly effective happy-chemical triggers that bide us through until the next 9-6. We wake up 20 years later and wonder where our lives went.

Perhaps leisure time is meant to be used to &ldquo;expand and develop ourselves to reach after our better nature, and to acquire the tools with which to change society&rdquo;, as sociologist [Theodor Adorno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YGnPgtWhsw) believed in the early 1900s.

Or perhaps leisure time is the [basis of culture](https://www.amazon.com/Leisure-Basis-Culture-Josef-Pieper/dp/0865972109).

Or perhaps leisure time is meant to be used to escape to the designed experiences of Caribbean resorts or cruise ships, instead of &ldquo;activities that don't cost much, like going for long walks around the local neighborhood, or writing poetry...[both of which] are seens as unimpressive slightly eccentric things,&rdquo; as Alain de Botton [eloquently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9zThcMJzQU) puts it when describing his dystopian (and strikingly familiar) *Richland*.

Or perhaps leisure time is to be altogether avoided, since it is the case that: &ldquo;Idle hands are the devilâ€™s workshop.&rdquo; &mdash; *Proverbs 16:27*


You decide.

If you even have the privileged ability to do so, that is.
