# 2020 Year in Review

<subtitle>Living in a world without Truth. One must imagine Sisyphus writing his own narrative.</subtitle>

<span className="lead">The most important thing </span> that I learned this year is that the closer you get to the Truth, the less you have to say.

And **The New York Times** sure has a lot to say...



## New things i tried

### Hobbies

1. Brewed my first kombucha batch. Flavors I've made: grapefruit, pomegranate, and a ginger/cinammon/anise blend.

2. Did some earnest backyard farming. Best yields were from: lettuce, bitter melon, &amp; cherry tomatoes. Modest to low yields from: bottle gourds, garlic, peas, beets, bell peppers.


### Technical

1. Built my own [PC](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/pringshia/saved/gPpNcf). Mostly learned via YouTube and searching /r/buildapcsales.

2. Set up a home NAS, or network access server, with 36 TB of storage. Planning to use this to store computer backups, captured photos & videos, and other digital media.

3. Mined my first crypto &mdash; 0.05 Ethereum.
