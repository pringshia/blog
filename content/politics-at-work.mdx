# Politics in the Workplace

I've figured out the easiest, most non-controversial statement to make that is **guaranteed** to solicit bountiful offerings of validation, agreement, and sympathy.

#### &ldquo;There's too much politics at work.&rdquo;

Why does this statement resound so unanimously? What even is *politics*? And why is it so commonly painted as a source of frustration?

<hr />

### The most useless statement ever

Before I saddle up to get on my high horse, I want to admit fully and thoroughly that I'm very guilty of making this statement. In fact, it was my own experience of complaining about workplace politics that sparked my curiousity.

I was introduced to the quote &ldquo;Be wary of all earnestness&rdquo; by Mike Rowe (of *Dirty Jobs* fame), who himself was quoting literary character Travis McGee. I definitely noticed an immense earnestness and righteousness within myself whenever I would denounce workplace politics, and therein my inner suspicion was provoked.

This inner suspicion gave way to self-reflection: Was I being fair and reasonable? Was I being productive and industrious with my discontent? Or was I running on an emotional treadmill while patting myself on the back?

<hr />

#### &ldquo;There's too much politics at work.&rdquo;

What is politics? Is it quantifiable? If not, how can there be &ldquo;too much&rdquo; of it? Why do we all tend to have such a poor relationship with it and seek to abolish it?

This is my current working definition:
#### Politics is the system that emerges to manage human influence.

One *key* point with this definition: Politics naturally emerges anytime you have more than one person in some ecosystem. Any time there are at least two people, they exert influence over one another, and some system of politics emerges. In this way it is an emergent property of social interaction. You CANNOT have NO politics.

Which leads me to a second point:

#### Seeking the absence of politics is in itself a political stance.

Here I draw on some wisdom from others, consider this an effort to provide supporting adjunct views that shed light upon some larger truth (in spirit of the [blind men and an elphant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant) parable):

1. The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude. &mdash; George Orwell, in [Why I Write](http://orwell.ru/library/essays/wiw/english/e_wiw)

2. You may say you’re against status, but if you filled a room with people who said they were anti-status, a hierarchy would soon form based on how anti-status they are. &mdash; Loretta G. Breuning Ph.D., in [I Mammal: Why Your Brain Links Status and Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/15935199-i-mammal-why-your-brain-links-status-and-happiness)

3. Nature abhors a vacuum. &mdash; Aristotle

In this sense, complaining about politics at work is a pointless waste of time. Politics will always exist at work. The type of politics in play is the talking point, not the existence of it.

<hr />

### A systemic lack of empathy towards the political

Given the previous conclusion that politics is an emergent and necessary property of human interaction, simply concluding that politics is good or, more commonly, is bad, is not a meaningful discussion. It is akin to vaguely saying that energy is bad. Energy can be used for good (fire providing warmth) or for bad (nuclear weapons demolishing civilization), but the fact that it exists alone is not a basis of moral judgment. Therefore this discussion needs some nuance.

*Why do so many of us complain about workplace politics, to the point where it's almost a cliché or meme?*

Perhaps it is simply a case of selection bias. Those that are the victims of politics are the ones that are vocal about it. Those that are beneficiaries simply have no reason to complain. So all we hear are the complaints.

Additionally, cause to complain is almost universal. It is almost certain that there will be times at work that we do not get what we want. Since it's impossible to please all the people all the time, there are guaranteed to be times when we get the short end of the stick. And so, everyone at some point has something to add to the chorus of complaints denouncing politics.

And so we come upon the age-old inner turmoil of human existence: Should we accept this situation, or try to change it?

Those that try to change it, can come across two ways. They can come across as virtuous and noble. Or they can come across as the term that's often derogatorily used: &ldquo;political&rdquo;.

When we are caught in the crossfire of someone else's political ploy, we often get frustrated. But are we open to acknowledging our own ploys? To ourselves, our own efforts may seemly feel justified, noble, and necessary, instead of being political.

Also, if we instead choose to feel like we are better than politics and just go about our business without getting involved, are we really any better? We are still embedded within the system and are perpetuating it, we've just resigned our claims to influence and claimed virtue in that resignation. When we continually get taken advantage of, we lament and moan and complain, and blame the system. But we never really tried to change it. We pigeonholed ourselves by thinking that the game was "bad" and we were "good" for not playing it, leaving the only path to ever playing again being to make the difficult self-reconciliation of our self-imposed belief that we are "bad" for playing. It is hard to become the very thing we spent our whole lives hating. This alone serves as imprisoning shackles for most.

<hr />

What makes it really easy to build a life of hating politics is our lack of empathy towards those who see virtue in influence.

To understand this idea, we must have had experiences with influence ourselves, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to have those experiences early in modern society. Getting promotions and tons of work experience helps us to move up society's version of the influence ladder, but there is such a delayed timeline to getting these necessary leadership/influential experience in our increasingly specialized and centralized industrial society. In the meanwhile, the older we get, we have more and more invested in our beliefs, making changing that that much harder. We are losing our ability to jump the fence and have empathy the longer we wait.

It is also my controversial claim that the loss of community &amp; extended tribes robs us of opportunities to learn to command influence at a young age. This gives rise to increasing cases of social awkwardness and anxieties. The modern schooling system is where we try to figure out what influence means, but without any healthy adult role models to demonstrate what proper influence entails, children resort to bullying, cliques, etc.

All this to say, modern society has become so increasingly centralized and detached, that we spend the majority of our times as leaves of the hierarchy tree. In being at the bottom of this tree, we do not have the opportunity to have enough healthy experiences seeing ourselves as noble, influential agents of change. In fact, we sometimes come to resent those that do, simply because (1) we have not learned the skills ourselves to engage with them in a healthy way, or (2) we have moral hang-ups about engaging with them due to our noble renunciation of &ldquo;being political&rdquo;.

<hr />

Perhaps it is time we all learned to acknowledge our inherent political natures and learned how to manage it, rather than refusing to acknowledge it or play the game altogether. In doing so, we can learn healthy, positive aspects of managing workplace politics. If not, we will all become increasingly more helpless to those that do. I've found the excellent playlist of School of Life [short videos (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpeuwUhM0OT338_T5XTtJJok) on political theory to be an excellent jumping off point into the learnings of politics from first principles. You may be surprised to find a little bit of Adam Smith, Locke, Marx, and Machiavelli, in yourself, as I did.
