# The Perils of the Written Word

<span className="lead">To be frank, writing online</span> is a little scary. People ask me often why I don't do it much, and that's the simple answer.

For one, your words are **permanent** &mdash; etched forever in digital stone by virtue of [web crawlers](https://archive.org/web/), screenshots, and the like. Assume that any words tied to your name can and will be used against you in the court of judgment of any arbitrary reader at any future date. If the past is indicative of future norms, future &ldquo;you&rdquo; &mdash; no matter how different, evolved, or matured &mdash; will most likely be held *just* as responsible for those words as the present &ldquo;you&rdquo; was when typing them.

This means that every word you write will be irreversibly chained to each and every future permutation of your ever-changing self. Unforgivingly, you are forever defined. This seems like a tremendous commitment and liability.

Then there's the mob... and boy, they seem angrier than ever. Sacrificial lambs are seemingly offered left and right for every cause under the sun. Examples need to be made and values upheld. Justice must be served. In the execution of the mob's mission *du jour*, will your execution take place?

I've spent enough time on social media to see mobs do their work time and time again. Not any one mob in particular, for they come in many forms carrying many different ideas. However they all tend to be loud, rambunctious, righteous, blind, impact-seeking, alarmist, vindictive, unknowingly bloodthirsty, and trigger-happy. Stay well within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton window</a> (*see left*), and you are safe (yet boring). Step outside (where all the interesting discourse happens), and you are at their mercy. You must be made an example of. You see, it's just the *right* thing to do, isn't it?


Alas, social media is an extremely recent phenomena and I think we are all collectively still learning our manners. When should we act righteous, and when should we yield? When should we fight for the validity of our deepest held ideas and beliefs, and when should we allow ourselves to be tolerant &amp; accepting? When is acceptance okay, and when is it being negligent *vis-Ã -vis* enabling evil? These are tough things to figure out.

I am optimistic though. I couldn't refer you to any research or text, but I do have a conviction that human intelligence is an evolutionary byproduct of human connection/social interaction. The more connected we become, the more intelligent we must become to prevent us all from killing each other. Maneuvering social situations is *hard* and our intelligence is our saving grace. Increasing connectedness pushes our species and it's collective intelligence to greater heights, and that's great. Which bring us to now, a time when social media has ushered in an era of hyperconnectedness. We are not used to it, but we will adapt. I am optimistic that despite our early stumbling, our collective intelligence will over time  develop as we form new norms and expectations around this new way of being.

In the meanwhile, things are a bit of a shitshow. We as a society are still figuring things out, and that's okay. Unfortunately there have been and will continue to be many casualties during this learning process, via acts of bullying, shaming, [doxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing), character assassinations, etc. Our deepest tribalistic tendencies are being triggered and causing us to behave in intense ways. Most generations that committed acts of savagery, had some personal idea of what savagery was, yet righteously acted as they did despite this knowledge. They felt immune to their own definitions. Mobs tend to not be very reflective and self-aware. No group thinks, &ldquo;oh let's be savages today&rdquo;, they just act in the moment compelled by a deeply held sense of purpose and meaning. I wonder if the recent phenomena online is no different.

With this mindset, sharing your words online seems a somewhat dangerous act. The world hasn't quiet figured out the rules of social media yet. And in this wild-west era, you are offering to an increasingly polarized and hostile world a permanent and irreversible vulnerability, a way for someone to cut you down, to use snippets of you in their narrative under their creative license, and possibly sacrifice you in the name of their cause. Perhaps I'm being cynical, or perhaps I've overweighting the negative things I've seen. Writing anything online could seem reckless, irresponsible, and short-sighted. We proceed.

Welcome to my blog. This is my first post.

I hope to touch on many topics here, ranging from technology, psychology, philosophy, social commentary, group dynamics, relationships, mental models, the human experience, etc. I hope to strike a balance between the inspiring *&ldquo;The unexamined life is not worth living&rdquo;* and the pragmatic *&ldquo;An ounce of action is worth a ton of theory.&rdquo;* (credit to Socrates &amp; Ralph Waldo Emerson, respectively).
