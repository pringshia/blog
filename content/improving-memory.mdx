# Implementing a Spaced Repetition System to Improve My Memory

I've heard a lot about Anki and spaced repetition systems (SRS) in my &ldquo;online bubble of people who's opinion I respect&rdquo; lately.

This post is an on-going log journalling my experiences of getting to know more about this idea.

### Step 1: Doing deep dives to learn more

My first step in learning more about SRS is picking the right introduction. Via Twitter [threads](https://twitter.com/ncasenmare/status/1033705778652372994) and group chats in [communities](https://www.recurse.com/) that I belong to, I settled on these two (quite thorough) resources:

1. Augmenting Long-term Memory [2018](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)
2. Effective learning: Twenty rules of formulating knowledge [1999](https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules)
