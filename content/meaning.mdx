# Meaning

Here's a recursive philophical quandary for you if you weren't feeling _woke_ enough today:

**What is the meaning of meaning?**

For you to understand this question, the word &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; must have &ldquo;meant&rdquo; something to you. So there's a start. But how do you convey that experience back to someone, with words that _mean_ something to them?

This is my attempt to answer this question and to deconstruct &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;. Along the way we'll discuss practical takeaways that this deconstruction inspires.

Meaning is something very personal to all of us. It is the way we make sense of our individual experiences and realities.

There are some common ways that we all make sense of things. These meanings are often what unite us and allow us to relate to each other. They're human universals.

Here's a non-exhaustive sampling of examples:

- **Order &amp; Chaos**: Those times when you feel in control, and those times when you don't.
- **Good &amp; Bad**: What is acceptable, and what isn't. What causes you guilt and what doesn't.
- **Us &amp; Others**: When you feel included. When you feel excluded.
- **Gain &amp; Loss**
