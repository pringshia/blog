# Resource Stream

### Wed. Aug 22nd

- [Empowering Design (video)](https://vimeo.com/123488311) - Really like the story being told here, i.e. the distinction between what we are given by technology vs. what we actually desire. `#insightful` `#designing-better`

- Rediscovered Alan Kay's [reading list](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp) - a ton of recommended books by the computer science pioneer. `#collections` `#long-reading`

- A [notebook](http://notebook.maryrosecook.com/) of notes, insights, links, etc. curated by [Mary Rose Cook](http://maryrosecook.com). I could spend hours looking through these. `#collections`

- An [article](https://slate.com/culture/2018/08/reader-come-home-by-maryanne-wolf-reviewed.html) detailing how modern society/technology makes *deep reading* difficult. My takeaway is the [reinforcement](https://amzn.to/2MG33Op) of the notion that modern lifestyles make deep work difficult, and that it is up to the individual to consciously design localized systems to adjust for this gravity. `#call-to-action`

- Notes on [striking user interfaces](http://cognitivemedium.com/striking_ui/striking_ui.html) - What makes user interfaces compelling? What makes them easy to learn and discover? Touches on inspirations from game design, including one of my favorite games, [Braid](https://www.avclub.com/10-years-later-braid-remains-the-definitive-indie-game-1824114955).
