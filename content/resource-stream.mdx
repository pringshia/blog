# Resource Stream

### Thu. Aug 30th

- &ldquo;Productize yourself.&rdquo; &mdash; Naval Ravikant, Periscope [stream](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1lDGLaBmWRwJm) `#insightful` `#call-to-action`

- [Cities are not trees (PDF)](http://worrydream.com/refs/Alexander%20-%20A%20City%20Is%20Not%20A%20Tree.pdf), in the structural sense, and so should not be modeled as such. Christopher Alexander argues that a connected and overlapping &ldquo;semilattice structure&rdquo; is a better representation of the way humans are meant to live. Trees minimize overlapping parts &mdash; in effect isolating, comparmentalizing and dissociating us (e.g. work from live, old from young, scholars from the real world, etc.)
> &ldquo;When we think in terms of trees we are trading the humanity and richness of the living city for a conceptual simplicity which benefits only designers, planners, administrators and developers. Every time a piece of a city is torn out, and a tree made to replace the semilattice that was there before, the city takes a further step toward dissociation.&rdquo;

- The bash command `wc -l` [coded up](https://github.com/dan-f/concurrent-wc/) in various programming languages by some fellow Recursers. IMO, a good *"Hello World"-esque* way of seeing how different languages handle asynchrony, parallelism, and I/O. *(Note: In bash, `wc -l` gives a line count of all the files in the current directory.)*

### Mon. Aug 27th

- A [hypothesis](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/08/how-to-motivate-the-unmotivated.html) around motivating the unmotivated. Maybe instead of giving them advice, they're the ones asked to give advice?
> &ldquo;Although giving advice confers no new information to the advice giver, we thought it would increase the advice giver’s confidence.&rdquo;

### Sun. Aug 26th

- Guillermo Rauch asked [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1033545216844857351): &ldquo;What are some blog posts / essays / papers / books that you’ve enjoyed reading several times?&rdquo; The responses are great. `#collections`

- [How to build](https://medium.com/thinking-is-hard/live-like-a-hydra-c02337782a89) an &ldquo;antifragile&rdquo; framework for your life. `#organization`


### Sat. Aug 25th

- See your Twitter feed in chronological order, instead of the annoying &amp; &ldquo;intelligently&rdquo; shuffled default view &mdash; [realtwitter.com](http://realtwitter.com)
- America is [falling out of love (WSJ)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-has-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-sedan-1535169698?mod=hp_lead_pos5) with the sedan in favor of crossovers/SUVs (better utility, safety, and increasingly shrinking mileage tradeoff).
> "My sense of proportion tells me that oblong are more attractive than squares, just as a greyhound is more graceful than an English bulldog."
> 
> &mdash; Harley Earl, GM's head designer who helped define the sedan and the unique designs of 1950s America.

- Frustrated by having to keep up with the new iPhone every year? This idea of [planned obsolecence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) was popularized by the auto industry, specifically GM, in the 1920s in an effort to maintain unit sales after reaching market saturation. `#dark-patterns`

- The [anti-consumerism template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Anti-consumerism) on Wikipedia on the side of the above linked wiki article seems like a really enticing rabbit hole to go down. `#collections`

- Rediscovered [Jack Schaedler](https://jackschaedler.github.io/) after a fellow Recurser mentioned him as being one of the guys behind Ableton's [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/) interactive lesson. `#role-models`

### Wed. Aug 22nd

- [Empowering Design (video)](https://vimeo.com/123488311) - Really like the story being told here, i.e. the distinction between what we are given by technology vs. what we actually desire. `#insightful` `#designing-better`

- Rediscovered Alan Kay's [reading list](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp) - a ton of recommended books by the computer science pioneer. `#collections` `#long-reading`

- A [notebook](http://notebook.maryrosecook.com/) of notes, insights, links, etc. curated by [Mary Rose Cook](http://maryrosecook.com). I could spend hours looking through these. `#collections` `#role-models`

- An [article](https://slate.com/culture/2018/08/reader-come-home-by-maryanne-wolf-reviewed.html) detailing how modern society/technology makes *deep reading* difficult. My takeaway is the [reinforcement](https://amzn.to/2MG33Op) of the notion that modern lifestyles make deep work difficult, and that it is up to the individual to consciously design localized systems to adjust for this gravity. `#call-to-action`

- Notes on [striking user interfaces](http://cognitivemedium.com/striking_ui/striking_ui.html) - What makes user interfaces compelling? What makes them easy to learn and discover? Touches on inspirations from game design, including one of my favorite games, [Braid](https://www.avclub.com/10-years-later-braid-remains-the-definitive-indie-game-1824114955).
