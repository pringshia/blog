- [Empowering Design (video)](https://vimeo.com/123488311) - Really like the story being told here, i.e. the distinction between what we are given vs. what we actually desire. `#insightful` `#designing-better`

- Alan Kay's [reading list](http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp) - a ton of recommended books by the computer science pioneer. `#collections` `#long-reading`

- A [notebook](http://notebook.maryrosecook.com/) of notes, insights, links, etc. curated by [Mary Rose Cook](http://maryrosecook.com) `#collections`
